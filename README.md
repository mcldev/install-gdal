# Install GDAL

An attempt to keep a 'working' repository of installing GDAL on Amazon Linux 2 and Windows with Python libraries.


## GDAL and Python
There are two python wrappers for accessing GDAL C library functions.

1. `django.contrib.gis` the built in django wrapper for basic access to GDAL.
   - **Only** installs the Python bindings as `django.contrib.gis.gdal`
   - Requires GDAL libraries to be installed separately on the system 
   - It is only a simple version of the full GDAL libary
   >GeoDjango provides a high-level Python interface for some of the capabilities of OGR, including the reading and coordinate transformation of vector spatial data and minimal support for GDALâ€™s features with respect to raster (image) data.

2. `osgeo` (installed as `pip install gdal==3.1.4`) installs the OSGeo wrapper and GDAL libraries
   - Installs and builds **BOTH** Python bindings **AND** GDAL Libraries
   - GDAL Libraries are installed to the python env site-packages gdal directory
   - OSGeo will use these local library files
   - `django.contrib.gis` will **NOT** use these library files
